1. What are the HTTP verbs? Which CRUD action corresponds to each verb?

  Your answer: post, get, put, patch, delete. post is much like create, read is like get, put and patch are like update, and delete is delete

  Researched answer: CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. But put more simply, in regards to its use in RESTful APIs,
  CRUD is the standardized use of HTTP Action Verbs. This means that if you want to create a new record you should be using “POST.” 
  If you are trying to read a record, you should be using “GET.” To update a record utilizing “PUT” or “PATCH.” And to delete a record, using “DELETE.”


2. Why would you use object destructuring?

  Your answer: taking an object's items and making them into variables that can be reused for 
  the purpose of not having to constantly use dot notation when calling object properties.

4. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: An object is used to store data a class is used to render 

  Researched answer: An object is an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs.
  A class component requires you to extend from React.Component and create a render function which returns a React element


5. What did you learn during the group project this week? Please include any additional feedback you may have.

  Your answer: Learned that everybody has different ideas about even the most simple problems. These different solutions help to move the 
               project forward because there were many times when we had to go back to rewrite a function that had previously worked but 
               didn't return the data type that we were looking for.

  Your answer: divs are block-line elements while spans are in-line elements.

  (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) 
  and used to group larger chunks of code.


3. What is a CSS class? When should you use an id instead of a class?

  Your answer: class is a way of giving html elements a selector that can be used in css and js, but mostly just css. An id should be used when looking at a single html
               element that does not appear more than once. The id should also be used if you are looking to add js functionality to it.
